# PyPortScanner

PyPortScanner is a port scanner written in Python which can be used to scan both TCP and UDP ports.  

## Installation
Just download the code and run it.
```bash
https://github.com/MarkFoudy/PyPortScanner.git
```
Or clone the repo:
```bash
gh repo clone MarkFoudy/PyPortScanner
```

## Purpose
 My goal with this project was to create a functioning and operational port scanner that I could feel comfortable using to evaluate open ports on hosts on any network.   This project grew out of my desire to expand the functionality of another Python script I had written which solely scanned TCP ports.  The purpose of this project was to enhance the functionality of the script. As a result, I resolved early in the project to avoid the temptation to write the script using an Object Orientated programming approach. Python is a multi-paradigm programming language, meaning that it can be used for both structured programming such as this script and object-orientated programing. It also has an extensive library of modules which allow the coder to use Python for a variety of purposes. In fact, it is common to see Python utilized extensively by cybersecurity professionals, network engineers and data scientists
